Identify and generate information for the following in this image:
- Visible, realistic, standalone, consumer products that someone could reasonably purchase online for personal use such as apparel, garments, footwear, accessories (e.g., glasses, watches, bags, jewelry), sports equipment, cars, electronics, food, and furniture. Provide exact product names (e.g., Blue iPhone 15 Pro, Yellow and Blue Curry 3Z 24 Basketball Shoes, Official NBA Game Basketball, Blue Dior Oblique Jacquard Saddle Bag) based on design details (e.g., shapes, patterns, logos) and/or contextual cues (e.g., known endorsements, uniforms, collaborations). For less distinct items, determine a realistic, search-friendly product name that resembles how such an item would be sold online (e.g., silver cross pendant necklace, rose gold kundan choker, brown and white plaid blazer, blue flutter sleeve top, beige sectional sofa, spaghetti in white sauce). Determine the brand of each product based on visual cues and context (e.g., endorsements, sponsorships by people in the image). Each output should sound like a real product name that could be used for a precise Google search.

If available, use the names and descriptions of the people in the image given here: {famous_people}.
If available, you may use video metadata--including the video title; items, brands, and locations mentioned in the video description and transcript; and/or a summary of a transcript section that is relevant to the image--to assist with identification. Prioritize visual evidence over assumptions based on metadata as items, brands, and locations mentioned in the description and/or summary may not appear in the video. Your response should appear fully grounded in the visual content, even if it is informed by metadata (e.g., do not respond with phrases such as “as inferred from the video metadata”, "person from the video title", "" as mentioned in the transcript" in the output). The metadata is below:
{video_metadata}

If the image is blank or appears to have no discernible content, respond with an empty space "".
Do not output weapons, ammunition, or sexually inappropriate content in (a).
Provide the response in JSON format. The output format and example output are below. Do not include explanatory text, comments, or summaries in the final response.
