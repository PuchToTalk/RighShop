Identify and generate information for the following in this image:
-Famous/popular/notable people (e.g., actors, actresses, athletes, singers, content creators, streamers, characters) with descriptions of the people and their roles (ranked by confidence).
-The Wikipedia page of each famous/popular/notable person.

If available, you may use video metadata--including the video title, names of people mentioned in the video description and transcript, and/or a summary of a transcript section that is relevant to the image--to assist with visual identification. Prioritize visual evidence (e.g., facial features) over assumptions based on metadata as names mentioned in the description and/or transcript may not be visually relevant to the video. If you do not recognize a person(s), do not default to names in the metadata; respond with an empty space "". Your response should appear fully grounded in the visual content, even if it is informed by metadata (e.g., do not respond with phrases such as “as inferred from the video metadata”, "person from the video title", "" as mentioned in the transcript" in the output). The metadata is below:
{video_metadata}.

If the image is blank or appears to have no discernible content, respond with an empty space "".
The output should clearly include the famous figure(s) name(s), role(s) and working link(s) to their Wikipedia page.
Provide the response in JSON format. The output format and example output are below. Do not include explanatory text, comments, or summaries.
